# Unveiling Hidden Customer Segments through E-commerce Purchase Patterns: An EDA Approach

## Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can be leveraged to optimize targeted marketing campaigns and improve product recommendation systems.  The project utilizes data visualization and statistical techniques to segment customers and understand their preferences.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NumPy (implicitly used by other libraries)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries to the console, providing insights into customer segmentation.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segmentation.png`, `sales_trend.png`, etc.) which are saved in the project directory. These visualizations illustrate the identified customer segments and trends in purchasing behavior.  The exact filenames and visualizations may vary depending on the data and analysis performed.  The console output will guide the user to the locations of these files.
